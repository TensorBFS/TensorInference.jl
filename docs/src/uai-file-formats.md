# UAI file formats

The UAI Format consists of four potential parts (each associated with a file):

- [Model file format (.uai)](@ref).
- [Evidence file format (.evid)](@ref).
- [Query file format (.query)](@ref).
- [Results file format (.MAR, .MAP, .MMAP .PR)](@ref).

## Model file format (.uai)

We use the simple text file format specified below to describe problem
instances (Markov networks). The format is a generalization of the Ergo file
format initially developed by Noetic Systems Inc. for their Ergo software. We
use the *.uai* suffix for the evaluation benchmark network files.

### Structure

A file in the UAI format consists of the following two parts, in that order:

    <Preamble>

    <Function tables>

The contents of each section (denoted `<...>` above) are described in the
following:

#### Preamble

Our description of the format will follow a simple Markov network with three
variables and two functions. A sample preamble for such a network is:

    MARKOV
    3
    2 2 3
    2
    2 0 1
    2 1 2

The preamble starts with one line denoting the type of network. Generally, this
can be either `BAYES` (if the network is a Bayesian network) or `MARKOV` (in
case of a Markov network). However, note that this year all networks will be
given in a Markov networks (i.e. Bayesian networks will be moralized).

The second line contains the number of variables. The next line specifies the
cardinalities of each variable, one at a time, separated by a whitespace (note
that this implies an order on the variables which will be used throughout the
file). The fourth line contains only one integer, denoting the number of
cliques in the problem. Then, one clique per line, the scope of each clique is
given as follows: The first integer in each line specifies the number of
variables in the clique, followed by the actual indexes of the variables. The
order of this list is not restricted. Note that the ordering of variables
within a factor will follow the order provided here.

Referring to the example above, the first line denotes the Markov network, the
second line tells us the problem consists of three variables, let's refer to
them as `X`, `Y`, and `Z`. Their cardinalities are 2, 2, and 3 respectively
(from the third line). Line four specifies that there are 2 cliques. The first
clique is `X,Y`, while the second clique is `Y,Z`. Note that variables are
indexed starting with 0.

#### Function tables 

In this section each factor is specified by giving its full table (i.e,
specifying value for each assignment). The order of the factor is identical to
the one in which they were introduced in the preamble, the first variable have
the role of the 'most significant' digit. For each factor table, first the
number of entries is given (this should be equal to the product of the domain
sizes of the variables in the scope). Then, one by one, separated by
whitespace, the values for each assignment to the variables in the function's
scope are enumerated. Tuples are implicitly assumed in ascending order, with
the last variable in the scope as the 'least significant'. To illustrate, we
continue with our Markov network example from above, let's assume the following
conditional probability tables:

    X     P(X)
    0     0.436
    1     0.564

    X Y   P(Y,X)
    0 0   0.128
    0 1   0.872
    1 0   0.920
    1 1   0.080

    Y Z   P(Z,Y)
    0 0   0.210
    0 1   0.333
    0 2   0.457
    1 0   0.811
    1 1   0.000
    1 2   0.189

The corresponding function tables in the file would then look like this:

    2
    0.436 0.564

    4
    0.128 0.872
    0.920 0.080

    6
    0.210 0.333 0.457
    0.811 0.000 0.189

(Note that line breaks and empty lines are effectively just a whitespace,
exactly like plain spaces " ". They are used here to improve readability.)

### Summary

To sum up, a problem file consists of 2 sections: the preamble and the full the
function tables, the names and the labels. For our Markov network example
above, the full file will look like:

    MARKOV
    3
    2 2 3
    3
    1 0
    2 0 1
    2 1 2

    2
    0.436 0.564

    4
    0.128 0.872
    0.920 0.080

    6
    0.210 0.333 0.457
    0.811 0.000 0.189 

## Evidence file format (.evid)

Evidence is specified in a separate file. This file has the same name as the
original network file but with an added *.evid* suffix. For instance,
*problem.uai* will have evidence in *problem.uai.evid*. The file starts with a
line specifying the number of evidences samples. The evidence in each sample,
will be written in a new line. Each line will begin with the number of observed
variables in the sample, followed by pairs of variable and its observed value.
The indexes correspond to the ones implied by the original problem file. If,
for our above example, we want to provide a single sample where the variable Y
  has been observed as having its first value and Z with its second value, the
  file *example.uai.evid* would contain the following:

    1
    2 1 0 2 1

## Query file format (.query)

Query variables for marginal MAP (MMAP) inference are specified in a separate
file. This file has the same name as the original network file but with an added
*.query* suffix. For instance with respect to the UAI model format,
*problem.uai* will have evidence in *problem.uai.query*.

The query file consists of a single line. The line will begin with the number of
query variables, followed by the indexes of the query variables. The indexes
correspond to the ones implied by the original problem file.

For our example Markov network given Model Format, if we wanted to use Y as the
query variable the file *example.uai.query* would contain the following:

    1 1

As a second example, if variables with indices 0, 4, 8 and 17 are query
variables, the query file would contain the following:

    4 0 4 8 17

## Results file format (.MAR, .MAP, .MMAP .PR)

The rest of the file will contain the solution for the task. The first line must
contain one of the tasks (PR, MPE, MAR, MMAP, or MLC) solved.

### Marginals, MAR

A space separated line that includes:

- The number of variables in the model.
- A list of marginal approximations of all the variables. For each variable its
  cardinality is first stated, then the probability of each state is stated. The
  order of the variables is the same as in the model, all data is space
  separated.
- For example, a model with 3 variables, with cardinalities of 2, 2, 3
  respectively. The solution might look like this:

        3 2 0.1 0.9 2 0.3 0.7 3 0.2 0.2 0.6

### Marginal MAP, MMAP

A space separated line that includes:

- The number q of query variables
- the most probable instantiation, a list of variable value pairs for all q
  variables.
- For example, if the solution is an assignment of 0, 1 and 0 to three query
  variables indexed by 2 3 and 4 respectively, the solution will look as follows

        3 2 0 3 1 4 0

### Partition function, PR

Line with the value of the log10 of the partition function.

For example, an approximation ``log10 Pr(e) = -0.2008`` which is known to be an
upper bound may have a solution line:

    -0.2008
