# Probabilistic inference

*TensorInference* implements efficient methods to perform Bayesian inference in
*probabilistic graphical models*, such as Bayesian Networks or Markov random
fields. This page introduces probabilistic graphical models, provides an example
using a Bayesian network, and explains what probabilistic inference is,
including the different tasks it can involve.

## Probabilistic graphical models

A probabilistic graphical model (PGM) is a mathematical framework that uses
graphs to compactly represent complex multivariate statistical distributions.
They are used to reason in the presence of uncertainty. This reasoning process
is known as *probabilistic inference* and will be defined and discussed in
detail later on.

*Bayesian networks* and *Markov random fields* are popular types of PGMs. The
following PGM is an example of a Bayesian network called the *ASIA network*. It
was introduced by Lauritzen in 1988 [^lauritzen1988local].

This network represents a simplified example from the realm of medical
diagnosis, illustrating the probabilistic relationships between various random
variables that correspond to potential diseases, symptoms, risk factors, and
test results. It comprises a graph ``G = (\bm{V},\mathcal{E})`` and a
probability distribution ``P(\bm{V})``, where ``G`` is a directed acyclic graph,
``\bm{V}`` represents the set of variables, and ``\mathcal{E}`` is the set of
edges connecting these variables. We assume all variables are discrete. Each
variable ``V`` is quantified by a *conditional probability distribution* (CPD)
``P(V \mid pa(V))``, where ``pa(V)`` denotes the parent variables of `V.`
Collectively, these conditional probability distributions, together with the
graph G, induce a joint probability distribution over ``P(\bm{V})``, given by

```math
P(\bm{V}) = \prod_{V\in\bm{V}} P(V \mid pa(V)).
```

A *factor*, denoted as ``\phi_{\bm{V}}``, is defined over a set of variables
``\bm{V}``. It's a function that maps each instantiation ``\bm{V} = \bm{v}`` to
a non-negative number. It's important to note that a probability distribution is
a specific case of a *factor*. The *product* of two *factors*, ``\phi_{\bm{X}}``
and ``\phi_{\bm{Y}}``, is another *factor*, ``\phi_{\bm{Z}}``, where ``\bm{Z} =
\bm{X} \cup \bm{Y}``, and ``\phi_{\bm{Z}}(\bm{z}) =
\phi_{\bm{X}}(\bm{x})\phi_{\bm{Y}}(\bm{y})`` for the instantiations ``\bm{x}``
and ``\bm{y}`` that align with the instantiation ``\bm{z}``. The
*marginalization* of a *factor* ``\phi_{\bm{Y}}`` into ``\bm{X} \subseteq
\bm{Y}`` results in a new *factor* ``\phi_{\bm{X}}``, where each
``\phi_{\bm{X}}(\bm{x})`` is calculated by summing the values of
``\phi_{\bm{Y}}(\bm{y})`` for all ``\bm{y}`` that are consistent with
``\bm{x}``. **Importantly, factor marginalization and product operations form
the fundamental basis for conducting probabilistic inference in PGMs.**

## The inference tasks

Probabilistic inference is the process of determining the probability
distribution of a set of unknown variables, given the values of known variables
in a PGM. It encompasses several tasks that will be explained next.

Each task is performed with respect to a graphical model, denoted as
``G = \{\bm{V}, \bm{D}, \bm{\phi}\}``, where:

``\bm{V} = \{ V_1 , V_2 , \dots , V_N \}`` is the set of the modelâ€™s variables

``\bm{D} = \{ D_{V_1} , D_{V_2} , \dots , D_{V_N} \}`` is the set of discrete
domains for each variable, and

``\bm{\phi} = \{ \phi_1 , \phi_2 , \dots , \phi_N \}`` is the set of factors
that define the joint probability distribution of the model.

The variable set ``\bm{V}`` can be further partitioned into two subsets: the
evidence variables ``\bm{E}`` and the remaining variables ``\bm{V}^\prime =
\bm{V} \setminus \bm{E}``. Furthermore, within the set ``\bm{V}^\prime``, the
subset ``\bm{Q}`` denotes the query variables. These are the variables for which
we aim to estimate or infer values.

### Probability of evidence (PR)

Computing the partition function (ie. normalizing constant) or probability of
evidence:

```math
PR(\bm{V}^{\prime} \mid \bm{E}=\bm{e}) = \sum_{V^{\prime} \in \bm{V}^{\prime}} \prod_{\phi \in \bm{\phi}} \phi(V^{\prime},\bm{e})
```

This task involves calculating the probability of the observed evidence, which
can be useful for model comparison or anomaly detection. This involves summing
the joint probability over all possible states of the unobserved variables in
the model, given some observed variables. This is a fundamental task in Bayesian
statistics and is often used as a stepping stone for other types of inference.

### Marginal inference (MAR): 

Computing the marginal probability distribution over all variables given
evidence:

```math
MAR(V_i \mid \bm{E}=\bm{e}) = \frac{ \sum_{V^{\prime\prime} \in \bm{V}^{\prime}
\setminus V_i} \prod_{\phi \in \bm{\phi}} \phi(V^{\prime\prime},\bm{e}) }{
    PR(\bm{V}^{\prime} \mid \bm{E}=\bm{e}) }
```

This task involves computing the marginal probability of a subset of variables,
integrating out the others. In other words, it computes the probability
distribution of some variables of interest regardless of the states of all other
variables. This is useful when we're interested in the probabilities of some
specific variables in the model, but not the entire model.

### Maximum a Posteriori Probability estimation (MAP)

Computing the most likely assignment to all variables given evidence:

```math
MAP(V_i \mid \bm{E}=\bm{e}) = \arg \max_{V^{\prime} \in \bm{V}^{\prime}}
\prod_{\phi \in \bm{\phi}} \phi(V^{\prime},\bm{e})
```

In the MAP task, given some observed variables, the goal is to find the most
probable assignment of values to some subset of the unobserved variables. It
provides the states of variables that maximize the posterior probability given
some observed evidence. This is often used when we want the most likely
explanation or prediction according to the model.

### Marginal Maximum a Posteriori (MMAP)

Computing the most likely assignment to the query variables, ``\bm{Q} \subset
\bm{V}^{\prime}`` after marginalizing out the remaining variables ``\bm{Z} =
\bm{V}^{\prime} \setminus \bm{Q}``, also known as *hidden* or *latent*
variables:

```math
MMAP(V_i \mid \bm{E}=e) = \arg \max_{Q \in \bm{Q}} \sum_{Z \in \bm{Z}}
\prod_{\phi \in \bm{\phi}} \phi(Q, Z, e)
```

This task is essentially a combination of the MAR and MAP tasks. The MMAP task
involves finding the most probable assignment (the MAP estimate) for a subset of
the variables, while marginalizing over (summing out) the remaining variables.
This task is useful when we want to know the most likely state of some
variables, but there's some uncertainty over others that we need to average out.
