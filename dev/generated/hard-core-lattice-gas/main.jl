# # The hard core lattice gas
# ## Hard-core lattice gas problem
# Hard-core lattice gas refers to a model used in statistical physics to study the behavior of particles on a lattice, where the particles are subject to an exclusion principle known as the "hard-core" interaction that characterized by a blockade radius. Distances between two particles can not be smaller than this radius.

# Let define a $10 \times 10$ triangular lattice, with unit vectors
# ```math
# \begin{align}
# \vec a &= \left(\begin{matrix}1 \\ 0\end{matrix}\right)\\
# \vec b &= \left(\begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\end{matrix}\right)
# \end{align}
# ```

# There exists blockade interactions between hard-core particles.
# We connect two lattice sites within blockade radius by an edge.
# Two ends of an edge can not both be occupied by particles.

# These constraints defines an independent set problem that characterized by the following energy based model.
# Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges.
# The energy model for the hard-core lattice gas problem is
# ```math
# E(\mathbf{n}) = -\sum_{i \in V}w_i n_i + U \sum_{(i, j) \in E} n_i n_j
# ```
# where $n_i \in \{0, 1\}$ is the number of particles at site $i$, and $w_i$ is the weight associated with it. For unweighted graphs, the weights are uniform.
# $U$ is the repulsive interaction strength between two particles.
# To represent the independence constraint, we let $U = \infty$, i.e. coexitence of two particles at two sites connected by an edge is completely forbidden.
# The solution space hard-core lattice gas is equivalent to that of an independent set problem.
# The independent set problem involves finding a set of vertices in a graph such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent (i.e., there is no edge connecting them).
# One can create a tensor network based modeling of an independent set problem with package [`GenericTensorNetworks.jl`](https://github.com/QuEraComputing/GenericTensorNetworks.jl).

# There are plenty of discussions related to solution space properties in the `GenericTensorNetworks` [documentaion page](https://queracomputing.github.io/GenericTensorNetworks.jl/dev/generated/IndependentSet/).
# In this example, we show how to use `TensorInference` to use probabilistic inference for understand the finite temperature properties of this statistical model.
# We use [`TensorNetworkModel`](@ref) to convert a combinatorial optimization problem to a probabilistic model.
# Here, we let the inverse temperature be $\beta = 3$.

# To obtain two-site correlations, one can set the variables to query marginal probabilities manually.

# ## The most likely configuration
# The MAP and MMAP can be used to get the most likely configuration given an evidence.

# One can ue [`sample`](@ref) to generate samples from hard-core lattice gas at finite temperature.
# The return value is a matrix, with the columns correspond to different samples.
